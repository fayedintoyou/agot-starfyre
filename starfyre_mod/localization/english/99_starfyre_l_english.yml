 starfyre_startup.0001.t: "The Hidden Cache"
 starfyre_startup.0001.desc: "In a forgotten alcove beneath the walls of Starfall, behind stones worn smooth by salt wind and time, you find what your father's men told you would be here.\n\nA bundle wrapped in oilcloth and old leather. Inside: a dragon egg, its shell still faintly warm after all these decades, and a sword unlike any you have seen. The blade is dark as smoke, its ripples shimmering between Valyrian steel and star-metal.\n\nYou know this story, though no one ever told it to you whole. Your grandmother Vaella fled the Redgrass Field with an egg from a clutch smuggled out of Dragonstone for the Black Dragon himself. She carried it to Dorne, hid it at Starfall, and died keeping the secret. Your father Daemon found it years later. He traveled to Qohor and forged a sword from the fragments of a Blackfyre blade and metal from a fallen star. He named it Starfyre.\n\nThen he tried to hatch the egg.\n\nThe fire took him. The egg endured. His men — the ones who found you, the ones who call themselves Daemon's Faithful — carried out his last command: hide everything, and when the time was right, let his daughter choose.\n\nThe egg is warm in your hands. The sword fits like it was made for you.\n\nTwo bloodlines. Two legacies. One choice."

 starfyre_startup.0001.b: "These are mine — but I will keep my mother's name."
 starfyre_startup.0001.b.tt: "You will remain a Dayne, carrying the dragon's legacy in secret."
 starfyre_vs_sword_name: "Starfyre"
 starfyre_vs_sword_desc: "A bastard blade forged in Qohor by Daemon Dayne from fragments of a Valyrian steel sword and metal from a fallen star near Starfall. Its steel is dark as smoke with ripples of pale silver running through the metal like veins of light. The crossguard is wrought in the shape of dragon wings, and a single star sapphire is set in the pommel. Daemon named it Starfyre — two legacies made one. He never swung it in battle. That honor belongs to his daughter."

 starfyre_discover_cache_decision_desc: "Your father's men found you after his death. They spoke of something hidden at Starfall — a dragon egg, a sword, and a truth older and more dangerous than anyone suspects. Your father died trying to wake the egg. His last command was to let you choose what he could not finish."

 starfyre_dreams.0001.t: "A Dream of Wings"
 starfyre_dreams.0001.desc: "You wake gasping, drenched in sweat. The dream clings to you like smoke — a sky split by wings so vast they blotted out the stars. Fire pouring upward like a river flowing the wrong way. And beneath it all, a sound you felt more than heard: a heartbeat, deep and ancient, thrumming in time with your own.\n\nYou sit in the dark for a long time, listening to your own breathing. Your father had dreams like this. His men told you — toward the end, he barely slept at all. The dreams came every night, growing louder, growing closer, until he built the pyre.\n\nYou reach for the egg in the dark. It is warm."
 starfyre_dreams.0001.a: "What is happening to me?"
 starfyre_dreams.0001.b: "My father had these dreams. I know what they are."
 starfyre_dreams.0002.t: "A Father's Voice"
 starfyre_dreams.0002.desc: "You dream of your father.\n\nHe is standing in a room you do not recognize — stone walls, a low fire, maps spread across a table. He looks younger than you remember. Stronger. He is holding the egg in both hands, turning it slowly, studying the way the firelight plays across the shell.\n\nHe looks up. He sees you. His mouth moves — he is trying to tell you something — but no sound comes. Only the crackle of the fire and the slow, steady pulse of the egg between his palms.\n\nHe reaches toward you. The fire climbs. The dream breaks.\n\nYou wake with tears on your face and the taste of smoke in your throat."
 starfyre_dreams.0002.a: "Father... what were you trying to tell me?"
 starfyre_dreams.0002.b: "He knew what the egg needed. He tried and failed. I will not fail."
 starfyre_dreams.0003.t: "The Pyre"
 starfyre_dreams.0003.desc: "This time you see it all.\n\nA clearing in the hills east of Starfall. A pyre of driftwood and dragon-bone, built with care, soaked in oil. Your father stands before it, bare-chested, the egg cradled against his ribs. His men stand in a circle — the same men who found you years later, older now, their faces lit by torchlight.\n\nHe speaks to them. You cannot hear the words, but you see them nod. One of them is weeping.\n\nHe steps into the pyre. He lays the egg at the center. He takes a torch from the nearest man and touches it to the oil.\n\nThe fire takes him instantly. He does not scream — not at first. The flames climb his legs, his chest, his face. Then he screams. The egg sits in the heart of the blaze, untouched, uncracked, unmoved.\n\nThe fire eats everything. When dawn comes, his men sift through the ashes. The egg is there, whole and warm. Their lord is gone.\n\nYou wake screaming his name."
 starfyre_dreams.0003.a: "He gave everything and it was not enough."
 starfyre_dreams.0003.b: "The fire was right. But the blood was not enough — his was too thin. Mine is stronger."
 starfyre_dreams.0004.t: "The Egg Stirs"
 starfyre_dreams.0004.desc: "You have taken to sleeping with the egg beside you. You tell yourself it is foolish, that it is only stone, that your father's death proved it cannot be woken. You tell yourself this every night. And every night you reach for it anyway.\n\nTonight the dream is different. There is no fire. No wings. No pyre.\n\nYou are kneeling in perfect darkness, and the egg is in your hands. It pulses — once, twice — with a warmth that has nothing to do with the campfire outside your tent. You feel a heartbeat pressed against your palms. Not yours. Not your father's. Something older. Something patient.\n\nIt has been waiting. Not for him. For you.\n\nA voice — not a voice, a feeling, a certainty that floods through you like hot wine — says: I know you. I have always known you.\n\nYou wake. The egg is warm. It has always been warm. But tonight, for the first time, you believe it."
 starfyre_dreams.0004.a: "It knows me. It has always known me."
 starfyre_dreams.0004.a.tt: "The bond between you and the egg deepens. You are beginning to understand what your father could not."
 starfyre_dreams.0004.b: "I will keep it close. Every night. Let it feel my warmth."
 starfyre_dreams.0004.b.tt: "You sleep with the egg beside you, night after night, letting the bond grow."
 starfyre_dreams.0005.t: "Fire and Blood"
 starfyre_dreams.0005.desc: "You stand in the heart of a great pyre.\n\nThe flames climb around you — white, then gold, then a deep and furious red. Your clothes burn away. Your hair burns away. But your skin does not blister, and your lungs do not scream. The fire wraps around you like a lover's arms and you are not afraid.\n\nThe egg is in your hands. The shell is cracking.\n\nYou think of your father. He stood where you stand now. He burned. But you are not your father. Your grandmother carried this egg out of dragonfire and ruin, across a kingdom, through a war, and it survived. Your father tried to wake it with courage and it was not enough. It did not want courage. It did not want sacrifice.\n\nIt wanted you.\n\nThe shell splits. Something inside is pushing, struggling, alive — and then a sound tears through the fire: not a roar, not yet, but a cry. Small and fierce and hungry. It looks up at you with eyes like molten gold and you feel something ancient and terrible settle into your bones.\n\nYou wake. The egg sits where you left it, whole and unbroken. But your hands are trembling, and you know — you know with a certainty that frightens you — that the dream was not a dream.\n\nIt was a promise.\n\nThe egg is ready. The question is whether you are."
 starfyre_dreams.0005.a: "Fire cannot kill a dragon."
 starfyre_dreams.0005.a.tt: "You know what must be done. The time has come to hatch the egg."
 starfyre_dreams.0005.b: "My father died in the fire. I will not."
 starfyre_dreams.0005.b.tt: "You will attempt what your father could not — but you will succeed where he failed."
 starfyre_dreams.0005.c: "Not yet. The egg will wait for me, as it waited for him."
 starfyre_dragonstone_pilgrimage_decision: "Walk the Halls of Dragonstone"
 starfyre_dragonstone_pilgrimage_decision_desc: "Something is calling you to Dragonstone — the ancient seat of the dragonlords, where your bloodline's power first touched Westeros. Your grandmother Vaella carried a dragon egg from this island. Your father died trying to wake it. Perhaps the answers you seek lie where it all began."
 starfyre_dragonstone_pilgrimage_decision_tooltip: "Travel to Dragonstone and walk where the dragonlords once walked."
 starfyre_dragonstone_pilgrimage_decision_confirm: "I will go to Dragonstone."
 starfyre_dreams.1001.t: "The Dragonmont"
 starfyre_dreams.1001.desc: "You stand on the shore of Dragonstone as the surf crashes against black volcanic rock. The fortress rises above you, carved in the shape of dragons — stone wings, stone jaws, stone eyes that seem to follow you as you climb.\n\nThe air is different here. Warmer than it should be, even for a castle built on a volcano. You feel it in the soles of your boots, in the palms of your hands when you press them against the walls. The stone hums.\n\nYou find your way to the caverns beneath the Dragonmont. The heat is fierce. Steam rises from cracks in the earth, and the rock glows faintly with veins of molten light. You think of your grandmother Vaella, who left this island with an egg and a prayer. You think of your father, who tried to wake it with fire and paid with his life.\n\nYou kneel in the dark. You press your hands against the hot stone. And for a moment — just a moment — you feel what they must have felt. The old power. The fire beneath the world. Dragon blood calling to dragon stone.\n\nWhen you rise, you are shaking. But you are not afraid. You understand now. The egg was laid here, in fire and smoke and old magic. If it is to wake, the fire must come from here — from the blood of the mountain, from the heart of the dragonlords' power.\n\nOr perhaps from the blood of the dragon herself."
 starfyre_dreams.1001.a: "This is where it all began. This is where it begins again."
 starfyre_dreams.1001.a.tt: "You feel the ancient power of Dragonstone in your veins. You know where the egg must be hatched."
 starfyre_dreams.1001.b: "I will stay. I will listen to the mountain."
 starfyre_dreams.1001.b.tt: "You spend days in the volcanic caverns, letting the heat and the old magic seep into your bones."
