 starfyre_startup.0001.t: "The Hidden Cache"
 starfyre_startup.0001.desc: "In a forgotten alcove beneath the walls of Starfall, behind stones worn smooth by salt wind and time, you find what your father's men told you would be here.\n\nA bundle wrapped in oilcloth and old leather. Inside: a dragon egg, its shell still faintly warm after all these decades, and a sword unlike any you have seen. The blade is dark as smoke, its ripples shimmering between Valyrian steel and star-metal.\n\nYou know this story, though no one ever told it to you whole. Your grandmother Vaella fled the Redgrass Field with an egg from a clutch smuggled out of Dragonstone for the Black Dragon himself. She carried it to Dorne, hid it at Starfall, and died keeping the secret. Your father Daemon found it years later. He traveled to Qohor and forged a sword from the fragments of a Blackfyre blade and metal from a fallen star. He named it Starfyre.\n\nThen he tried to hatch the egg.\n\nThe fire took him. The egg endured. His men — the ones who found you, the ones who call themselves Daemon's Faithful — carried out his last command: hide everything, and when the time was right, let his daughter choose.\n\nThe egg is warm in your hands. The sword fits like it was made for you.\n\nTwo bloodlines. Two legacies. One choice."

 starfyre_vs_sword_name: "Starfyre"
 starfyre_vs_sword_desc: "A bastard blade forged in Qohor by Daemon Dayne from fragments of a Valyrian steel sword and metal from a fallen star near Starfall. Its steel is dark as smoke with ripples of pale silver running through the metal like veins of light. The crossguard is wrought in the shape of dragon wings, and a single star sapphire is set in the pommel. Daemon named it Starfyre — two legacies made one. He never swung it in battle. That honor belongs to his daughter."

 starfyre_dreams.0001.t: "A Dream of Wings"
 starfyre_dreams.0001.desc: "You wake gasping, drenched in sweat. The dream clings to you like smoke — a sky split by wings so vast they blotted out the stars. Fire pouring upward like a river flowing the wrong way. And beneath it all, a sound you felt more than heard: a heartbeat, deep and ancient, thrumming in time with your own.\n\nYou sit in the dark for a long time, listening to your own breathing. Your father had dreams like this. His men told you — toward the end, he barely slept at all. The dreams came every night, growing louder, growing closer, until he built the pyre.\n\nYou reach for the egg in the dark. It is warm."

 starfyre_dreams.0003.desc: "This time you see it all.\n\nA clearing east of Starfall. A pyre of driftwood and dragon-bone. Your father steps into the blaze with the egg in his hands. His men watch in silence, broken by one man's sob.\n\nAt dawn, only the egg remains warm. Your father is ash.\n\nYou wake screaming his name."
